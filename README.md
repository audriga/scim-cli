## Info

**scim-cli** is a command line interface (CLI) which makes it easy to send requests to a [SCIM v2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scim/documents/) server.

It is built on the following IETF approved RFCs: [RFC7642](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642), [RFC7643](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643) and [RFC7644](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644) and uses the [scim-client-dart](https://github.com/audriga/scim-client-dart) library.

For now, **scim-cli** is integrated into the [scim-client-dart](https://github.com/audriga/scim-client-dart) repository.
